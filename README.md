### Network Creation

## Objective
Using Cisco's Packet Tracer, my goal was to create a mock network that could be used for a medium sized company accross multiple sites. It needed to have one router per site and two sites having a DHCP servers with multiple computers or laptops connected to their sites router. I also wanted one site to have only servers, one DNS and one HTTP. I configured all the routers at each site with their ip addresses, subnet masks, and gateways. Once finished I want to be able to ping a server from a router at a different site. 

## Skills Learned
- Knowledge in building a network
- Ability to configure routers and servers
